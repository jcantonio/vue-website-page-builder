## Documentation

### Requirements

Please note that these instructions assume you have Node.js installed.

- Node.js ‚â• 18.0.0
- Vue.js ‚â• 3.0.0
- Modern browser with ES6+ support

### Getting started & installation

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# yarn
yarn install

# bun
bun install
```

### Quick Start

```vue
<script setup>
import { PageBuilder } from '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder'
import '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder/style.css'
</script>

<template>
  <PageBuilder />
</template>
```

> **üìù Note**: Google Fonts (Jost, Cormorant) and Material Icons are automatically loaded when you import the CSS file. No additional setup required for fonts or icons!

### Updating Existing Resources

To load existing content that was created with this PageBuilder:

- Use `sharedPageBuilderStore` to ensure the external PageBuilderClass and internal PageBuilder component share the same state
- Import `PageBuilderClass` which contains all methods to manipulate and control the page builder state - in this case we need the `loadExistingContent()` method to load existing content into the page builder
- The PageBuilderClass uses the shared store to maintain state consistency between external operations and the internal PageBuilder component, ensuring that when you load content externally it appears correctly in the PageBuilder interface
- Set formType to "update" to tell the PageBuilder that you're editing an existing resource rather than creating a new one, which affects how the component handles data and interactions

1. **Set formType to "update"** in template:

```javascript
<PageBuilder
    updateOrCreate: {
      formType: 'update',
    }
/>
```

2. **Load existing content on mount**:

```javascript
import { onMounted } from 'vue'
import {
  PageBuilder,
  PageBuilderClass,
  sharedPageBuilderStore,
} from '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder'

const pageBuilderStateStore = sharedPageBuilderStore
const pageBuilderClass = new PageBuilderClass(pageBuilderStateStore)

onMounted(() => {
  pageBuilderClass.loadExistingContent(existingResourceFromBackend)
})
```

### Customization

Customizing the page builder is made simple since all the logic resides in the PageBuilder Class.

### Custom Components

Want to add your own media library or search functionality? Create custom components that can be injected into the page builder:

üìö **[Custom Components Setup Guide](./CUSTOM_COMPONENTS_SETUP.md)** - Learn how to create and integrate your own components

Example integration:

```vue
<script setup>
import { PageBuilder } from '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder'
import MediaLibraryComponent from './ComponentsPageBuilder/MediaLibraryComponent.vue'
import SearchComponent from './ComponentsPageBuilder/SearchComponent.vue'
</script>

<template>
  <PageBuilder :MediaLibraryComponent="MediaLibraryComponent" :SearchComponent="SearchComponent" />
</template>
```

### Company Logo

You can display your company logo in the page builder interface by passing a logo URL to the `PageBuilderLogo` prop. When provided, the logo will appear in the top toolbar of the page builder.

Basic Usage:

```vue
<script setup>
import { PageBuilder } from '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder'
import '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder/style.css'
</script>

<template>
  <PageBuilder PageBuilderLogo="/logo/square-logo.svg" />
</template>
```

configuration Options

| Prop              | Type     | Default | Description                         |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `PageBuilderLogo` | `String` | `null`  | URL path to your company logo image |

#### Examples

The logo will be displayed with a subtle border separator and proper spacing in the page builder toolbar.

## Troubleshooting

### Fonts or Icons Not Displaying

If fonts (Jost, Cormorant) or Material Icons are not displaying correctly, verify that:

1. **CSS Import**: Ensure you're importing the CSS file:

   ```js
   import '@myissue/vue-website-page-builder/style.css'
   ```

2. **Network Access**: The package loads fonts and icons from Google Fonts CDN. Ensure your application can access:

   ```
   https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Jost:*
   https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cormorant:*
   https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined
   ```

3. **Content Security Policy**: If using CSP, allow Google Fonts:
   ```html
   <meta
     http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
     content="font-src 'self' https://fonts.googleapis.com;"
   />
   ```
